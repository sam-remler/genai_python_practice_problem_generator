### Title: Spiral Matrix

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Problem Statement:**
Given a matrix of size `m x n`, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order. Starting from the top left corner and moving to the right, the elements should be collected in a spiral fashion until all elements have been traversed.

**Input Format:**
- A list of lists (matrix) representing the `m x n` matrix. Each inner list will contain `n` elements.

**Output Format:**
- A single list containing the elements of the matrix in spiral order.

**Constraints:**
- The matrix dimensions `m` and `n` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
- The values of the elements in the matrix will be integers in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

**Example Test Cases:**

1. **Input:**
   ```python
   matrix = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]
   ]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```python
   [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
   ```

2. **Input:**
   ```python
   matrix = [
       [1, 2],
       [3, 4]
   ]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```python
   [1, 2, 4, 3]
   ```

3. **Input:**
   ```python
   matrix = [
       [1],
       [2],
       [3]
   ]
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```python
   [1, 2, 3]
   ```
